# About

Concert Locator is an application that assists you in finding concerts near you!  
Using your location and a few preferences, you can find an upcoming event to attend and enjoy with a friend, family member, loved one, or even just go to alone!

By utilizing the Ticketmaster API and MapQuest API, Concert Locator pinpoints your coordinates and finds venues in your area and selects a show for you according to your specific preferences.
* What kind of music do you like?
* How far are you willing to travel?  
From answering those two questions and inputting your address, you will get a list of concerts you might be interested in!
